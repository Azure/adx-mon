# ADX Operator: Named Entity-Groups for Federated Clusters

## Problem Statement

The ADX operator for federated clusters currently creates cross-cluster functions using the `macro-expand` operator with inline entity groups. While this approach works well, there is an opportunity to enhance the federation capabilities by also providing named entity-groups as an additional abstraction layer.

**Proposed Enhancement**: Implement named entity-groups that are stored in the database metadata and automatically maintained by the operator. These entity-groups will represent logical collections of partition clusters for each database, providing an additional way for users to query across federated data with a simpler syntax when desired.

## Current Architecture Analysis

Based on `operator/adx.go`, the federation system works as follows:

### Partition Clusters (Role: "Partition")
- Send heartbeats every 10 minutes via `HeartbeatFederatedClusters()` 
- Collect schema metadata (databases, tables, views) from their local cluster
- Send this data to federated clusters via CSV ingest into heartbeat tables
- Heartbeat data includes: timestamp, cluster endpoint, schema JSON, partition metadata

### Federated Clusters (Role: "Federated") 
- Receive heartbeats in heartbeat table (schema: `Timestamp: datetime, ClusterEndpoint: string, Schema: dynamic, PartitionMetadata: dynamic`)
- Query heartbeat table every 10 minutes via `FederateClusters()`
- Create cross-cluster functions using `macro-expand` with inline entity groups
- Current function generation in `generateKustoFunctionDefinitions()`:
  ```kusto
  .create-or-alter function TableName() { 
    macro-expand entity_group [cluster('endpoint1').database('db'), cluster('endpoint2').database('db')] as X { X.TableName } 
  }
  ```

## Proposed Entity-Groups Enhancement

### New Function: `ensureEntityGroups()`

Add a new step in `FederateClusters()` between steps 5-6 to create/update named entity-groups alongside the existing function generation:

**Location**: `operator/adx.go` in `FederateClusters()` method, after `ensureDatabases()` call at line ~945

**Logic**:
1. For each database discovered from heartbeat data, create a named entity-group
2. Entity-group name pattern: `{DatabaseName}_Partitions` (e.g., `Metrics_Partitions`, `Logs_Partitions`)
3. Use `.create-or-alter entity_group` command to ensure entity-groups are updated as partition clusters change
4. Entity-group contains all active partition cluster endpoints for that database

### Additional Query Options

With named entity-groups in place, users will have multiple ways to query federated data:

**Option 1: Existing Functions (unchanged)**:
```kusto
TableName()  // Uses existing macro-expand functions with inline entity groups
```

**Option 2: Direct Entity-Group Usage (new)**:
```kusto
macro-expand Metrics_Partitions as X { X.TableName }
```

**Option 3: Advanced Custom Queries (new)**:
```kusto
// Users can create their own functions using the entity-groups
.create function MyCustomMetricsQuery() {
    macro-expand Metrics_Partitions as X { 
        X.TableName 
        | where Timestamp > ago(1h)
        | summarize count() by bin(Timestamp, 5m)
    }
}
```

### Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Provides additional query patterns while preserving existing functionality
- **Advanced Use Cases**: Power users can leverage entity-groups for custom federation logic
- **Consistency**: Entity-groups are automatically maintained as partition clusters change
- **Future-Proofing**: Creates foundation for additional federation enhancements

## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Add Entity-Group Creation Function ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `operator/adx.go`
**Function**: `ensureEntityGroups(ctx context.Context, client *kusto.Client, dbSet map[string]struct{}, schemaByEndpoint map[string][]ADXClusterSchema) error`

**Implementation**: ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Iterate through each database in `dbSet`
2. ✅ Collect all cluster endpoints that have that database from `schemaByEndpoint`
3. ✅ Build entity reference list: `cluster('endpoint').database('dbname')` for each endpoint
4. ✅ Check if entity-group exists using `.show entity_groups`
5. ✅ Execute `.create entity_group` (new) or `.alter entity_group` (existing) as appropriate
6. ✅ Log entity-group creation/updates for observability
7. ✅ Added helper function `entityGroupExists()` for existence checking

**Location**: ✅ Inserted after line ~945 in `FederateClusters()` method

### Task 2: Keep Existing Function Generation Unchanged ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `operator/adx.go`  
**Function**: `generateKustoFunctionDefinitions()`

**No Changes Required**: ✅ VERIFIED - The existing function generation logic remains completely unchanged to maintain backward compatibility. The current inline entity-group approach continues to work as before:

```kusto
.create-or-alter function TableName() { 
  macro-expand entity_group [cluster('endpoint1').database('db'), cluster('endpoint2').database('db')] as X { X.TableName } 
}
```

✅ **Verification Completed**: All existing queries and workflows continue to function without modification.

### Task 3: Integration with Existing System ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `operator/adx.go`
**Location**: `FederateClusters()` method

**Changes**: ✅ ALL COMPLETED
1. ✅ Add call to `ensureEntityGroups()` after `ensureDatabases()` (line ~954)
2. ✅ Entity-group creation runs independently of existing function generation
3. ✅ Add proper error handling and logging for entity-group operations  
4. ✅ Ensure entity-group creation failures don't affect existing function generation

**Note on Reconciliation**: ✅ VERIFIED - No additional requeuing logic is required. The existing `FederateClusters()` method already returns `ctrl.Result{RequeueAfter: 10 * time.Minute}`, which ensures entity-groups will be automatically updated every 10 minutes as partition clusters join/leave the federation. This maintains consistency with the existing function generation cycle.

### Task 4: Add Entity-Group Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED (Optimized Implementation)
**Function**: Integrated into `ensureEntityGroups()` (optimized approach)

**Implementation**: ✅ COMPLETED with significant optimization
- **Combined Operations**: Merged cleanup logic into `ensureEntityGroups()` for efficiency
- **Zero-Heartbeat Protection**: Added safety check to prevent mass deletion when no heartbeat data received
- **Single Query Pass**: Eliminated duplicate `.show entity_groups` calls between functions
- **Granular Error Handling**: Continue processing other databases even if one fails
- **Memory Efficient**: Track only `_Partitions` suffix entity-groups for cleanup

**Critical Issue Identified and Fixed**: ✅ RESOLVED
During implementation, we identified a potential data loss issue where a zero-result from the Heartbeat table (e.g., during network outages, all partition clusters down, or temporary issues) could lead to erroneous cleanup of all entity-groups. The optimized implementation includes:
- **Early Exit Protection**: If `len(schemaByEndpoint) == 0`, skip all entity-group operations
- **Safety Warning**: Log warning when no heartbeat data received to prevent accidental cleanup
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function with existing entity-groups until heartbeat data returns

**Flow**:
1. Check for zero heartbeat data → early exit if none (prevents mass deletion)
2. For each database:
   - Query existing entity-groups once
   - Create/update entity-groups for active heartbeat data
   - Remove only stale entity-groups not marked as active
3. Robust error handling ensures database-level failures don't stop processing

**Note**: Removed separate `cleanupStaleEntityGroups()` function as cleanup is now efficiently integrated into the main entity-group management flow.

### Task 5: Testing and Validation ✅ COMPLETED
**Files**: `operator/adx_test.go`

**Test Cases**: ✅ ALL IMPLEMENTED
1. ✅ **Zero Heartbeat Protection**: Test critical safety check that prevents mass deletion when no heartbeat data received
2. ✅ **Entity-Group Name Generation**: Validate naming convention `{DatabaseName}_Partitions`
3. ✅ **Entity Reference Construction**: Test cluster reference format `cluster('endpoint').database('db')`
4. ✅ **Database Filtering Logic**: Ensure only databases in `dbSet` are processed
5. ✅ **Stale Entity-Group Detection**: Test logic for identifying and cleaning up stale entity-groups
6. ✅ **Multiple Endpoints for Same Database**: Validate handling of multiple cluster endpoints for the same database

**Implementation**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Test Function**: `TestEntityGroupLogic()` in `operator/adx_test.go`
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests covering all core logic without requiring Kusto integration
- **Mock Strategy**: Used logic-based testing instead of external dependencies per guidance
- **All Tests Passing**: ✅ Verified with `go test ./operator -v`

**Note**: Integration tests with actual Kusto avoided per guidance - entity-groups not supported in localhost/testcontainer environments and mock endpoints fail validation.

### Task 6: Update Documentation ✅ COMPLETED
**Files**: 
- ✅ `docs/designs/operator.md` 
- ✅ `docs/concepts.md`

**Documentation Updates**: ✅ ALL COMPLETED
1. ✅ **Operator Design Document** (`docs/designs/operator.md`):
   - Added comprehensive "Entity-Groups for Federation" section after existing federation content
   - Documented entity-group creation process and naming convention (`{DatabaseName}_Partitions`)
   - Explained the new query options available to users with detailed examples
   - Included comparison between generated functions and direct entity-group usage
   - Documented safety features (zero-heartbeat protection, automatic cleanup)
   - Added advanced usage scenarios including geographic filtering and cross-entity-group joins

2. ✅ **Concepts Document** (`docs/concepts.md`):
   - Updated "Federation & Multi-Cluster" section to mention entity-groups
   - Added new "Querying Federated Data" subsection showing both approaches
   - Included practical examples of generated functions vs entity-group usage
   - Integrated entity-groups naturally into existing federation concepts

3. ✅ **Content Added**:
   - Entity-group naming convention and lifecycle management
   - Usage examples from simple queries to advanced federation scenarios  
   - Benefits: flexibility, advanced filtering, custom logic, future-proofing
   - Safety and error handling documentation
   - Performance and efficiency considerations
   - **Automatic Maintenance**: Entity-groups are updated as partition clusters are added/removed
   - **Direct Usage**: Advanced users can use entity-groups in custom queries:
     ```kusto
     // Direct entity-group usage
     macro-expand Metrics_Partitions as X { X.TableName | where Timestamp > ago(1h) }
     
     // Custom function creation
     .create function MyMetricsQuery() {
         macro-expand Metrics_Partitions as X { 
             X.TableName 
             | summarize count() by bin(Timestamp, 5m) 
         }
     }
     ```
   
   This enhancement preserves all existing functionality while providing additional flexibility for power users.
