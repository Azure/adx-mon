## Context Section

### Feature Overview
Fix the timing bug where `LastSuccessfulExecution` timestamp becomes stuck and doesn't advance when backlog operations are successfully recovered, preventing forward progress in time window processing.

### Research Summary
- **Current Behavior**: `processBacklogOperation` successfully submits backlog operations and assigns operation IDs, but does NOT update `LastSuccessfulExecution` timestamp
- **Expected Behavior**: `LastSuccessfulExecution` should advance whenever we successfully submit operations that would move the timestamp forward (regardless of whether via normal submission or backlog recovery)
- **Architecture Pattern**: SummaryRule status conditions track execution state and timing for scheduling decisions

### Architectural Context
The SummaryRule execution flow has two submission paths:
1. **Normal submission** (`handleRuleExecution`): Calls `SetLastExecutionTime(windowEndTime)` ✅
2. **Backlog recovery** (`processBacklogOperation`): Successfully submits operations but does NOT call `SetLastExecutionTime()` ❌

### Production Impact
Real SummaryRule in production shows:
- **LastSuccessfulExecution message**: `"2025-08-01T18:00:00Z"` (stuck since 2025-08-01T18:35:13Z)
- **Latest successful operation**: `6d035fd6-6459-4fb6-8931-64d63a1f0c8c` with window ending `"2025-08-06T08:00:00Z"`
- **Gap**: 5+ days of successful operations not reflected in timestamp advancement

### Key Patterns
- **Status Conditions**: Use `meta.SetStatusCondition` to update CRD status with proper timing
- **Time Windows**: Operations have `startTime`/`endTime` representing the data window being processed
- **Forward Progress**: Only update timestamp if `new_timestamp > current_timestamp` to prevent time travel
- **Backlog Recovery**: `processBacklogOperation` handles failed submissions but must also maintain timestamp progression

### Integration Points
- **CRD Status Management**: `SetLastExecutionTime` updates the `LastSuccessfulExecution` condition
- **Scheduling Logic**: Next execution windows calculated from `LastSuccessfulExecution` timestamp
- **Operation Lifecycle**: Async operations tracked from submission through completion
- **Backlog System**: Failed submissions recovered without timestamp updates (BUG)

### Dependencies
- `api/v1/summaryrule_types.go`: `SetLastExecutionTime` method implementation
- `ingestor/adx/tasks.go`: Normal submission and backlog recovery handling
- Kusto async operation status tracking

## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Overall Feature Risk: **LOW**
**Rationale**: Adding missing timestamp update to existing successful code path with forward-progress guard.

### Major Component Risks:

#### Timing Logic Changes
- **Potential Issues**: 
  - Timestamp could advance too aggressively
  - Backlog operations from past could move timestamp backwards
  - Multiple operations in same cycle could cause unnecessary updates
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Operations completing out of order
  - Clock skew between submission and recovery
  - Time parsing failures during recovery
  - Mixed success/failure states
  - Clock skew between submission and completion
- **Integration Risks**: 
  - Scheduling logic depends on accurate timestamps
  - Monitoring/alerting may rely on timestamp progression
- **Integration Risks**: 
  - Scheduling logic depends on accurate timestamps
  - Monitoring/alerting may rely on timestamp progression
- **Mitigation Strategies**: 
  - Only update timestamp when it would advance forward (`new > current`)
  - Use operation's original window end time, not current time
  - Maintain existing timestamp format and precision
  - Add proper error handling for time parsing
- **Validation Checkpoints**: 
  - Verify timestamp advances only for newer operations
  - Check scheduling still works with updated timing
  - Ensure old backlog operations don't cause regression

## Task Breakdown (Commit-Optimized)

### Task 1: Add test demonstrating the backlog timestamp bug
- **Commit Message**: `test(summaryrule): add test demonstrating backlog timestamp advancement bug`
- **Objective**: Create failing test that shows `processBacklogOperation` doesn't advance timestamps
- **Risk Assessment**: LOW - Adding test coverage for existing bug
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Files to modify**: `ingestor/adx/tasks_test.go`
  - **Test scenario**: Backlog operation with newer window should advance timestamp
  - **Expected failure**: Timestamp remains at old value despite successful backlog recovery
  - **Test pattern**: Follow existing test patterns for backlog operations

### Task 2: Fix backlog operation timestamp advancement  
- **Commit Message**: `fix(summaryrule): advance LastSuccessfulExecution timestamp for backlog operations`
- **Objective**: Ensure `processBacklogOperation` updates timestamp when it would advance forward
- **Risk Assessment**: LOW - Adding missing timestamp update with forward-progress guard
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **Files to modify**: `ingestor/adx/tasks.go`
  - **Add to `processBacklogOperation`**: Parse operation's `EndTime` and conditionally call `SetLastExecutionTime`
  - **Forward progress condition**: Only update if `new_timestamp > current_timestamp`
  - **Time handling**: Add OneTick back since operation.EndTime has it subtracted

- **Research References**: 
  - Existing `SetLastExecutionTime` implementation in `api/v1/summaryrule_types.go:113`
  - Current backlog recovery in `processBacklogOperation` around line 494
  - Normal submission timing in `handleRuleExecution` around line 413

- **Integration Notes**: 
  - Preserve existing timestamp format (RFC3339Nano)
  - Use operation's original `EndTime`, not current timestamp
  - Only operations that advance timestamp should update it
  - Handle time parsing errors gracefully

- **Implementation Pattern**:
```go
func (t *SummaryRuleTask) processBacklogOperation(ctx context.Context, rule *v1.SummaryRule, operation v1.AsyncOperation) {
	if operationId, err := t.SubmitRule(ctx, *rule, operation.StartTime, operation.EndTime); err == nil {
		// Great, we were able to recover the failed submission window.
		operation.OperationId = operationId
		rule.SetAsyncOperation(operation)
		
		// Update timestamp only if it would advance forward
		if endTime, parseErr := time.Parse(time.RFC3339Nano, operation.EndTime); parseErr == nil {
			windowEndTime := endTime.Add(kustoutil.OneTick) // Add OneTick back
			currentTimestamp := rule.GetLastExecutionTime()
			
			// Only advance if the new timestamp is newer (forward progress)
			if currentTimestamp == nil || windowEndTime.After(*currentTimestamp) {
				rule.SetLastExecutionTime(windowEndTime)
			}
		} else {
			logger.Errorf("Failed to parse EndTime '%s' for backlog operation: %v", operation.EndTime, parseErr)
		}
	}
}
```

- **Validation Criteria**: 
  - Backlog operations with newer timestamps advance `LastSuccessfulExecution`
  - Backlog operations with older timestamps do NOT advance `LastSuccessfulExecution`
  - Timestamp reflects operation's actual data window end time  
  - Normal submission path continues working unchanged
  - Test demonstrates bug before fix, passes after fix

- **Review Guidance**: 
  - Focus on forward-progress logic: only advance when newer
  - Verify backlog operations update timestamp appropriately
  - Check that time parsing errors are handled gracefully
  - Ensure production case (2025-08-01 → 2025-08-06) would be fixed

## Documentation Plan

### Existing Documentation Updates
- **File**: Inline comments in `processBacklogOperation`
- **Content**: Document the timestamp update logic and forward-progress requirement

### Documentation Tasks
No separate documentation commits needed - this is an internal bug fix with clear inline documentation.

## Implementation Notes

### Error Handling Patterns
- Only update timestamp for successful backlog recoveries
- Handle time parsing errors gracefully (log error, skip timestamp update)
- Don't fail backlog processing if timestamp update fails
- Preserve existing error handling for submission failures

### Configuration
No new configuration options needed - this corrects existing behavior.

### Backward Compatibility
- **Behavioral Change**: Timestamps will now advance when backlog operations are recovered
- **Impact**: More accurate timing for monitoring, resolves stuck timestamp scenarios
- **Migration**: No migration needed - stuck timestamps will naturally advance as backlog clears

### Performance Considerations
- **Minimal Impact**: Single additional time parse and comparison per successful backlog recovery
- **Memory**: No additional memory overhead
- **Concurrency**: No new concurrency considerations
