Please analyze all configuration structs, validation logic, and comments in the collector configuration code under cmd/collector/config, including:

1. All struct definitions and TOML tags in config.go
2. Validation rules and required fields in config.go and config_test.go
3. Exporter configuration in export.go
4. Example configurations and error cases in config_test.go

Then, compare the actual implementation to the documentation in docs/config.md. Identify any discrepancies, missing fields, outdated examples, or undocumented validation rules.

Update the documentation as follows:
- Add any missing configuration options or sections
- Update field descriptions, types, and validation requirements
- Revise or add example configurations to match the code
- Ensure all validation rules and default values are documented
- Remove or correct any outdated information

Note: docs/config.md is generated by tools/docgen/config. Update the docgen tool's config.go and template as needed, then regenerate docs/config.md using the documented process (e.g., go run tools/docgen/config/config.go).

The goal is for docs/config.md to accurately and completely reflect the current collector configuration implementation, including all options, defaults, and validation rules.
