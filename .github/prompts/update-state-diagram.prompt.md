Please analyze all state transitions in the operator code for both correctness and forward progress, particularly focusing on:

1. The ResourceHandler's HandleEvent method and its usage of OperatorServiceReason
2. The handleAdxEvent function's state machine implementation
3. The OrchestrateResources function's condition checks
4. Any setCondition calls that change the status of resources

Then update the state diagram in docs/designs/operator.md to accurately reflect:
- All possible states from OperatorServiceReason
- The conditions that trigger state transitions
- Any substates within the Installing state
- Relevant notes about what causes state transitions
- Terminal states and error conditions

The state diagram should help users understand:
- The current state of their CRD by inspecting subresources
- What state transitions are possible from their current state
- What conditions might cause state changes
- The progression of the installation/reconciliation process

Please maintain the existing mermaid stateDiagram-v2 format and ensure the diagram remains clear and readable.

Additionally, examine all return statements in state transition code and validate they maintain proper control flow. For example, a statement like 'return ctrl.Result{}, nil' in a non-terminal state without setting a new condition would break reconciliation and should be flagged.
