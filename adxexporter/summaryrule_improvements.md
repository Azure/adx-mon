# SummaryRule reconciler: readability and maintainability improvements

This note proposes targeted, low-risk refactors to improve clarity, consistency, and long‑term maintainability of `adxexporter/summaryrule.go`, without changing behavior.

## TL;DR (top priorities)
- Remove unused `QueryExecutors` from this reconciler or wire it meaningfully; it’s currently initialized but not used.
- Extract duplicated helpers and constants (operation ID parsing, Kusto async states, timeouts) to a shared place.
- Simplify and guard the async tracking flow (avoid double-handling completed ops; prefer else-if; unify status updates).
- Centralize status updates: set conditions once and persist once per reconcile loop.
- Clarify requeue logic with named constants and a small helper.

---

## 1) Structure and naming
- Introduce private helpers for the three gating steps at the top of `Reconcile`:
  - `isDatabaseManaged(rule)` – maps to the database gating.
  - `criteriaMatch(rule)` – wraps `matchesCriteria` usage.
  - `adoptIfDesired(ctx, rule)` – handles the SafeToAdopt+PatchClaim path.
  These reduce “busy” flow in `Reconcile` and make intent clearer.

- Align variable naming for operation IDs. Use `opID` consistently for locals and parameters (struct fields remain `OperationId` to match Kusto schema). E.g. `getOperation(ctx, db, opID string)`.

- Move file-scoped “magic” strings to constants:
  - Kusto async states: `Completed`, `Failed`.
  - Default submit and poll timeouts.
  - Consider hoisting to a shared package if used elsewhere (see section 3).

## 2) Status and updates
- Avoid multiple `Status().Update` calls per reconcile. Today we:
  - Call `updateSummaryRuleStatus` inside submit and failure paths (which itself calls `Status().Update`).
  - Also call `Status().Update` again at the end after `trackAsyncOperations`.

  Prefer a single write per reconcile:
  - Change `updateSummaryRuleStatus` to only mutate the in-memory object (set `Condition`), returning no error. Defer the actual `Status().Update` to the single final update near the end of `Reconcile`.
  - Benefit: fewer API writes, reduced conflict potential, clearer side‑effects.

- Consider adding a small accumulator (e.g., `statusDirty bool`) to indicate that status changed during processing and only call `Status().Update` when needed.

## 3) Extract small helpers/constants within exporter
- `operationIDFromResult` and Kusto async state strings appear in multiple exporter files. Extract into a single exporter location to avoid duplication (e.g., `adxexporter/kusto.go` or a new `adxexporter/internalutil.go`).

- Centralize default timeouts in exporter scope:
  - Submit: 5 minutes
  - Poll: 2 minutes
  Define once in the exporter package and reference consistently.

## 4) Async tracking flow
- In `trackAsyncOperations`, avoid double handling of completed ops and retries:
  - Today: after `handleCompletedOperation` we still check `ShouldRetry` and may attempt a retry.
  - Adjust to:
    - Backlog (empty `OperationId`) → process backlog.
    - Else fetch status →
      - if completed (succeeded or failed): handle completion and `continue`.
      - else if `ShouldRetry != 0`: handle retry.

- Consider logging at debug level when an operation isn’t found (may be pruned) to reduce noise.

- Keep the “truncate status to ~200 chars” pattern when surfacing Kusto errors in conditions; that’s good guardrail.

## 5) Requeue strategy clarity
- Make requeue decisions explicit via a helper:
  - `nextRequeue(rule, hasInflight bool) time.Duration`
  Logic:
  - Start with `rule.Spec.Interval.Duration`.
  - If there are inflight/backlog operations, use `SummaryRuleAsyncOperationPollInterval` if shorter.
  - Fallback minimum of 1 minute.

- Add a brief comment to explain that `GetAsyncOperations()` will normally contain the just-submitted window and any backlog windows, which is why “> 0” implies we should poll more frequently.

## 6) Kusto interaction safety and observability
- Good: using `AddString()` for `OperationId` injection safety and `context.WithTimeout`.
- Consider adding the rule identity and window to submit logs at `Info` level (db, table, start, end, opID when present). Tests already validate behavior; logging won’t change semantics.
- Consider surfacing the Kusto endpoint in debug logs to aid multi‑cluster debugging (avoid spamming Info).

## 7) Ownership/adoption path
- The adoption flow looks correct. Minor refinements:
  - On successful adoption patch, we immediately `RequeueAfter: 5s`. Extract `const adoptRequeue = 5 * time.Second` for clarity.
  - If `SafeToAdopt` returns `(false, err)` where `err != nil`, optionally log at debug to highlight why adoption didn’t occur.

## 8) Criteria and database gating
- The gating order is sensible (DB → criteria → ownership). Consider short, intention-revealing helper names and early returns to keep `Reconcile` compact.
- If we keep `QueryExecutors` in this reconciler for future use, add a doc comment clarifying its purpose; otherwise remove it to lower cognitive load (see section 9).

## 9) Fields and initialization simplification
- `QueryExecutors map[string]*QueryExecutor` appears unused here (it is used by MetricsExporter). Options:
  - Remove the field and related initialization from `SummaryRuleReconciler` to reduce surface area; or
  - If you anticipate near‑term usage, add at least one reference or explanatory comment. Currently it adds complexity without value.

- `initializeQueryExecutors` currently builds both `KustoExecutors` and `QueryExecutors`. If the reconciler only needs management commands:
  - Initialize just `KustoExecutors` here; let MetricsExporter manage its own query executors (it already does in its own reconciler).

## 10) Tests (small deltas)
- Add a unit test asserting the else‑if ordering in `trackAsyncOperations` (completed operations are not retried).
- Add a unit test to ensure only a single `Status().Update` happens per reconcile when both submission and async tracking change the status (can be verified by a fake client that counts status updates or by structuring the reconciler to expose a hook).
- If we extract helpers/constants inside exporter, relocate or add tests alongside them (e.g., operation ID parsing happy/edge paths).

## 11) Documentation and comments
- Expand the high-level comment above `Reconcile` describing the overall lifecycle:
  - gating → potential submission → backfill → track async ops → single status update → requeue decision.
- Add a docstring to `getOperation` emphasizing the “direct lookup” approach (no 24‑hour window limitation), matching the rationale in the ingestor code.

## Suggested constants (names only)
- `const (
    adoptRequeue = 5 * time.Second
    submitTimeout = 5 * time.Minute
    pollTimeout = 2 * time.Minute
    stateCompleted = "Completed"
    stateFailed    = "Failed"
  )`

Keep these constants within the exporter unless a future need arises to share them.

## Non-goals (out-of-scope now)
- Cross‑component redesign or behavior changes.
- Changing CRD schema or the meaning of existing conditions.
- Introducing new external dependencies.

## Expected impact
- Clearer, shorter `Reconcile` body.
- Fewer status write races and cleaner controller-runtime interactions.
- Shared utilities prevent drift between Ingestor and Exporter paths.
- Easier onboarding for future contributors; less duplication of “how async ops are handled.”
