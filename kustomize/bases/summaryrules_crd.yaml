                  Key/Value pairs used to determine when a summary rule can execute. If empty, always execute. Keys and values
                  are deployment specific and configured on ingestor instances. For example, an ingestor instance may be
                  started with `--cluster-labels=region=eastus`. If a SummaryRule has `criteria: {region: [eastus]}`, then the rule will only
                  execute on that ingestor. Any key/values pairs must match (case-insensitive) for the rule to execute.
                type: object
              criteriaExpression:
                description: |-
                  CriteriaExpression is an optional CEL (Common Expression Language) expression that provides a richer way
                  to determine if the summary rule should execute. The CEL environment is dynamically constructed from the
                  ingestor's cluster labels (e.g. region, cloud, and any --cluster-labels key/value pairs). All variables are
                  exposed as strings and can be referenced directly by their label name. For example:

                    criteriaExpression: "region in ['eastus','westus'] && environment == 'prod'"

                  Execution semantics:
                    * If neither criteria nor criteriaExpression are specified, the rule always executes.
                    * If only criteriaExpression is specified, it must evaluate to true for the rule to execute.
                    * If only criteria (map) is specified, existing matching behavior (any key/value match) applies.
                    * If both are specified, the rule executes when BOTH the criteria map matches AND the expression evaluates to true.

                  An invalid expression (parse or type check error) will be treated as an error and prevent the rule from executing.

              ingestionDelay:
                description: |-
                  IngestionDelay is subtracted from the execution window start and end times to account
                  for data ingestion latency, ensuring the query only processes fully ingested data.
                  NOTE: Current implementation also subtracts this delay from the "now" used to decide
                  whether an interval has elapsed (i.e. scheduling readiness). This effectively lengthens
                  wall‑clock spacing between executions to Interval + IngestionDelay. If you intend only
                  to shift the processed window but keep wall‑clock cadence at Interval, this behavior
                  will be adjusted in a future release.
