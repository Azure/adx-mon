                  Key/Value pairs used to determine when a summary rule can execute. If empty, always execute. Keys and values
                  are deployment specific and configured on ingestor instances. For example, an ingestor instance may be
                  started with `--cluster-labels=region=eastus`. If a SummaryRule has `criteria: {region: [eastus]}`, then the rule will only
                  execute on that ingestor. Any key/values pairs must match (case-insensitive) for the rule to execute.
