                  Criteria for cluster-based execution selection (same pattern as SummaryRule)
                  Key/Value pairs used to determine when a metrics exporter can execute. If empty, always execute. Keys and values
                  are deployment specific and configured on adxexporter instances. For example, an adxexporter instance may be
                  started with `--cluster-labels=region=eastus,environment=production`. If a MetricsExporter has `criteria: {region: [eastus], environment: [production]}`, then the rule will only
                  execute on that adxexporter. Any key/values pairs must match (case-insensitive) for the rule to execute.

              criteriaExpression:
                description: |-
                  CriteriaExpression is an optional CEL (Common Expression Language) expression that provides a richer way
                  to determine if the metrics exporter should execute. The CEL environment is dynamically constructed from the
                  exporter's cluster labels (e.g. region, cloud, environment, and any --cluster-labels key/value pairs). All variables
                  are exposed as strings and can be referenced directly by their label name. For example:

                    criteriaExpression: "region in ['eastus','westus'] && environment == 'prod'"

                  Execution semantics mirror AlertRule:
                    * If neither criteria nor criteriaExpression are specified, the exporter always executes.
                    * If only criteriaExpression is specified, it must evaluate to true for execution.
                    * If only criteria is specified, existing matching behavior (any key/value match) applies.
                    * If both are specified, BOTH must match (criteria map match AND expression true).

                  An invalid expression (parse or type check error) will be treated as an error and prevent execution.
