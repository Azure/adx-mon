                  Key/Value pairs used to determine when an alert can execute.  If empty, always execute.  Keys and values
                  are deployment specific and configured on alerter instances.  For example, an alerter instance may be
                  started with `--tag cloud=public`. If an AlertRule has `criteria: {cloud: public}`, then the rule will only
                  execute on that alerter. Any key/values pairs must match (case-insensitive) for the rule to execute.
                type: object
              criteriaExpression:
                description: |-
                  CriteriaExpression is an optional CEL (Common Expression Language) expression that provides a richer way
                  to determine if the alert should execute. The CEL environment is dynamically constructed from the alerter's
                  execution context (cloud, region, and any --tag key/value pairs). All variables are exposed as strings and
                  can be referenced directly by their tag name. For example:

                    criteriaExpression: "cloud == 'public' && region in ['eastus','westus'] && env == 'prod'"

                  Execution semantics:
                    * If neither criteria nor criteriaExpression are specified, the rule always executes.
                    * If only criteriaExpression is specified, it must evaluate to true for the rule to execute.
                    * If only criteria (map) is specified, existing matching behavior (any key/value match) applies.
                    * If both are specified, the rule executes when BOTH the criteria map matches AND the expression evaluates to true.

                  An invalid expression (parse or type check error) will treated as an error and prevent the rule from executing.
