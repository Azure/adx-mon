# ADX-Mon


ADX-Mon is a comprehensive observability platform that seamlessly integrates metrics, logs, traces, continuous profile
and any telemetry into a unified platform. It addresses the traditional challenges of data being siloed and difficult
to correlate, as well as the cardinality and scale issues found in existing metrics solutions, streamlining the
collection and analysis of observability data.

## Features

* **Unlimited Cardinality, Retention, and Granularity**: No restrictions on data dimensions, storage duration, or detail level.
* **Low Latency Ingestion and Lightweight Collection**: Ensures rapid data processing with minimal resource overhead.
* **Unified Alerting**: Simplified alerting mechanisms for metrics, logs, and traces.
* **Adaptive Ingestor Autoscaling**: CPU-aware control loop that safely scales StatefulSet replicas with dry-run support.
* **Granular Conditional Execution**: Unified `criteria` + CEL `criteriaExpression` gating across AlertRule, SummaryRule, and MetricsExporter CRDs for fine-grained deployment scoping.
* **Powered by Azure Data Explorer (ADX)**: Built on the robust and scalable [ADX](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-explorer) platform with the powerful [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) unifying access to all telemetry.
* **Flexible and Standards-Based Interfaces**: Supports OTEL, Prometheus, and other industry standards ingestion protocols.
* **Optimized for Kubernetes and Cloud-Native Environments**: Designed to thrive in modern, dynamic infrastructures.
* **Pluggable Alerting Provider API**: Customizable alerting integrations.
* **Broad Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Grafana, ADX Dashboards, PowerBI, and any ADX-compatible products.
* **Turnkey, Scalable, and Reliable**: A ready-to-use observability platform that scales from hobby projects to enterprise-level deployments.

## Testing alertrules
Prereq: some k8s cluster you have kubeconfig for (can be minikube or kind)

1. az login to the account that has acces to the kusto clusters. 
1. apply crds :  k apply -f kustomize/bases/alertrules_crd.yaml 
1. apply your alert rules (probably in a different repo)
1. cd cmd/alerter
1. go run . --kusto-endpoint "<database>=<kustourl>"  --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config. The database much match the one in your alert rule (case-sensitive)
1. optionally specicfy arugments that will be filled into query if needed like --region uksouth
1. You should both see  "Creating query executor for..." and "Fake Alert Notification Recieved..." if your query gets results.
