## Testing alertrules
Prereq: some k8s cluster you have kubeconfig for.

1. az login to the account that has acces to the kusto clusters. 
1. apply crds :  k apply -f kustomize/bases/alertrules_crd.yaml 
1. apply your alert rules (probably in a different repo)
1. cd cmd/alerter
1. go run . --kusto-endpoint "<database>=<kustourl>"  --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config. The database much match the one in your alert rule (case-sensitive)
1. optioally specicfy arugments that will be filled into query if needed like --region uksouth
1. You should both see  "Creating query executor for..." and "Fake Alert Notification Recieved..." if your query gets results.
