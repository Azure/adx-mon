# Management Commands

## Background

We have internal tooling that performs various management commands against our Kusto clusters. We aim to retire this tooling by integrating these commands into adx-mon. Examples of such commands include [Workload Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/management/workload-groups?view=microsoft-fabric) and [Request Classification Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/management/request-classification-policy?view=microsoft-fabric).

Our existing _Functions_ CRD can handle such commands, but we plan to introduce validation to our _Functions_ to prevent arbitrary management commands. Therefore, we will not use _Functions_ for management commands.

## Goals

Enable the execution of arbitrary management commands for Kusto cluster configuration.

## Non-goals

Implementing security or RBAC for these commands is not within the scope of this initial design.

## Proposed Solution

We will define a new CRD, `ManagementCommands`, to support the execution of arbitrary management commands against a Kusto cluster. This CRD will ensure that we continually drive towards a desired state rather than executing commands as one-shot operations.

### CRD

```yaml
apiVersion: adx-mon.azure.com/v1
kind: ManagementCommand
metadata:
  name: some-request-classification
spec:
  database: OptionalDatabase
  body: |
    .alter cluster policy request_classification '{"IsEnabled":true}' <|
        case(current_principal_is_member_of('aadgroup=somesecuritygroup@contoso.com'), "First workload group",
            request_properties.current_database == "MyDatabase" and request_properties.current_principal has 'aadapp=', "Second workload group",
            request_properties.current_application == "Kusto.Explorer" and request_properties.request_type == "Query", "Third workload group",
            request_properties.current_application == "KustoQueryRunner", "Fourth workload group",
            request_properties.request_description == "this is a test", "Fifth workload group",
            hourofday(now()) between (17 .. 23), "Sixth workload group",
            "default")
```

To support management commands scoped to a database, we will provide an optional `database` parameter.
